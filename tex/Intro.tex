\section{Motivation}
Wireless communications need, among other resources, radio-electric spectrum, which is finite. 
Government agencies, such as the FCC in the United States or the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) through national administrations in Europe, grant access to it through fixed, long-term licenses on large geographical areas, in what is called the "command-and-control" management scheme. 
Licenses were given to operators in national lotteries and comparative hearings first, and later through spectrum auctions. % Al principio, de hecho, las concedian en un first-come-first-served. Cuando la demanda creció, loterias y concursos. Finalmente, por aquello de que parece un procedimiento menos manipulable, las subastas.
Nevertheless, the ever-growing demand of spectrum due to the popularization of mobile services has left these traditional policies obsolete since almost all the spectrum has already been assigned. % Add figure (the typical with the spectrum assignments).

However, several reports have been pointing out that most of the licensed spectrum show very little use. In 2002, the FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force \cite{ref:FCC2002} highlighted that typical channel occupancy of some public safety community, for example, could be less than 15\%. The European Commission, in 2007, also stated that "some users hold large amounts of valuable spectrum that they do not use to its full capacity" \cite{ref:Commission2007}.

From early on, experts suggested \cite{ref:Valletti2001} it would be necessary to switch to a more flexible management to improve spectrum efficiency. In the US, the FCC started allowing license holders to lease their licenses under different constraints in 2003 \cite{ref:Mayo2010}, whereas in Europe is taking some more time: by 2011, only 9 out of 22 european countries surveyed by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) allowed spectrum leasing \cite{ref:ECC2011}. %OJO a la referencia a Mayo, explicitar a que estamos linkando mejor (no a ninguna ley de 2003).

Cognitive radios \cite{ref:Mitola1999} could elasticize spectrum management even further by enabling the automatic exploitation of unused spectrum opportunities anywhere in time, space, frequency, power and/or in CDMA codes.
A \emph{cognitive radio} has two main characteristics \cite{ref:Akyildiz2006}: cognitive capability and reconfigurability. 
Cognitive capability refers to the ability of the radio to become aware of its surrounding radio environment. Reconfigurability refers to the ability of the radio of changing its transmission parameters dynamically.

In the most typical scenario, secondary users (SUs, unlicensed), equipped with cognitive radios, would look for unused fragments of spectrum and would use them for their transmissions subject to interference constraints for the protection of primary users (PUs, licensed). 
This situation corresponds to the “Hierarchical Access Model”, one of the possible coexistence approaches under “Dynamic Spectrum Access” (DSA) but there are others \cite{ref:Zhao2007}. 
Along the lines of current regulation models is the “Dynamic Exclusive Use Model”, which considers leasing or selling licenses but at a smaller time-scale, even real-time and free choice of technology.
Lastly, the “Spectrum Commons Model”  assumes open sharing with no categories of users.

DSA has recently gained popularity because of the TV digitalization, in order to take advantage of the spectrum opportunities it has generated. % Añadir año. Explicar que se libera espectro procedente de las teles analogicas pero se nombra a algunos usuarios particulares como primarios.
Therefore, the last few years have seen some DSA standards such as IEEE 802.22 [9], ECMA-392 [10], 802.11af [12], 802.19.1 [11] and IEEE SCC41 [13].

No matter which model is considered, spectrum sharing can annoy licensed operators at present, because it may imply additional costs to them such as changes in their infrastructures, QoS impairments due to interferences or profit reduction due to increased competition, while they have already paid for their licenses. 
Protecting and creating incentives for PUs instead of forcing them avoids that actual spectrum owners as well as prospective ones feel discouraged from investing in new spectrum technologies and services: "why am I going to spend money in spectrum if the government is going to give it for free to others?".

Therefore, it is needed that these operators believe in an automated mechanism that controls their profits. But this idea alone is scary. "Is there any security on obtaining benefit"? It is hard to convince the telecommunications industry to adopt automated dynamic spectrum management mechanisms if there is no strong evidence that these algorithms do not lead to economic loses (due to disadaptation to real time, for example). Optimality, then, remains in the background.

Our\footnote{I will be using the first person plural voice by default throughout my thesis. Most of the ideas and work is a team effort involving my supervisor and other authors. This should not be detrimental of showing off my autonomy, but even my personal decisions where strongly inspired by other' opinions. Meaningful research is not done (should not be done) by a single person in a vacuum. Thus, I consider artificial the use of "I" here. In other parts of this work, such first person plural will also include the reader, primarily when describing mathematical derivations, as a natural way of walking him through the process.} \emph{motivation} in this thesis is, therefore, \emph{to develop dynamic spectrum access mechanisms with a strong focus on the protection and creation of incentives to the PUs.} 
On the other hand, secondary users also need an incentive to request spectrum from the primary operator (\textit{e.g.} customized tariffs). Otherwise, the approach will not work because they would all prefer to become primary users.

In addition, the main tendency of previous (and contemporaneous) solutions in the area has been building increasingly complex models, which deal with more issues of spectrum in more convoluted scenarios, and aiming to solve them optimally. 
Nonetheless, the resources required to reach such elaborated solutions have not been considered enough, specially time. Time consumption is a relevant issue because, as we have been pointing out throughout our survey, multiple important parameters in spectrum trading experience rapid variations over time: spectrum opportunities, demand (unplanned peaks of traffic), valuation of the spectrum (changes in channel gains, mobility of entities), etc.
In consequence, we think that \emph{time consumption should be regarded as a key feature in spectrum management algorithms}: if obtaining an optimal solution takes so long that the system’s parameters vary significantly during the computation time, this solution will be not optimal when applied. In addition, the more time devoted to negotiation among the agents, the less time used in transmission. For that reason, it is more practical to design models that may not fully exploit spectrum in a particular moment (for example, by not taking into account spectrum geographical reuse) but that are capable of reducing the uncertainty due to the changes over time, and thus, providing higher guarantees on the agents’ satisfaction. 

% Among all mechanisms proposed to improve spectrum efficiency such as forced resource allocation algorithms, automated spectrum trading has the advantage of providing economic (and/or other) incentives to the entities involved, especially important to licensed operators, encouraging their cooperation and promoting motivation for future investments in primary spectrum acquisitions.

%SPECTRUM TRADING
% Previous works in economic theory are not easily translated to spectrum trading because of the specific features of the traded good. A spectrum market poses the following addi- tional challenges:
% – Rapid variations with time
% – Imperfect information
% – Complex resource allocation considering re-utilization
% and heterogeneity of the good
% Both spectrum supply and demand changes are related to data traffic intensity which, in general, experiences rapid variations with time. In addition, spectrum characteristics are also highly variable, in particular, availability and channel quality parameters. This implies that the agents making the decisions in the spectrum markets have to be algorithmic. Automatic transactions are present in financial trading ([14]), but that market does not show the specific issues of spectrum trading.
% Imperfect information not only refers to the competitive behavior of agents in a traditional market, by which they are not willing to reveal their true valuation of a good. It also refers to the fact that agents may not have complete or reliable information about the market due to the communi- cation complexity that it would involve, specially in ad-hoc
% networks. It entails unfeasible requirements such as, for ex- ample, all entities knowing all channel gains between each other.
% Resource allocation becomes more complicated with spec- trum as a traded good because, depending on the mutual in- terference ranges of the entities, it can be spatially reused. It may also be considered that spectrum is an heterogeneous good, in the sense that the same spectrum portion can be valuated differently by each user, depending on its position, technology (spectrum efficiency use), etc.
% Rapid variations with time and resource allocation in complex models are tightly interrelated. Optimal resource allocation in complex models requires a computational time that makes it hard to keep up with the rapid changes, which, in turn, may render a solution inefficient because of a time dis-adaptation. Dealing with imperfect information makes optimal resource allocation more complex, even intractable. On the contrary, local estimations could be considered, sac- rificing model optimality for the sake of speed.
