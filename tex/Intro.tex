\section{Motivation}

Wireless communications need, among other resources, radio-electric spectrum, which is finite. 
Government agencies such as the FCC in the United States, grant acces to it through fixed, long-term licenses on large geographical areas, in what is called the "command-and-control" management scheme. %ECC en Europa, Ofcom en UK...
The ever-groing demand of spectrum due to the popularization of mobile services has left these traditional policies obsolete since almost all the spectrum has already been asigned. 
However, reports like the 2002 one of the FCC Spectrum Policy Task Force \cite{ref:FCC2002} pointed out that most of the licensed spectrum showed very little use and it would be necessary to switch to a more flexible, market-oriented management \cite{ref:Valletti2001} to improve efficiency. % Add figure (the typical with the assignments).\footnote{I will be using the first person plural voice by default throughout my thesis. Most of the ideas and work is a team effort involving my supervisor and other authors. This should not be detrimental of showing off my autonomy, but even my personal decisions where strongly inspired by other' opinions. Research is not done (or should not be done) by a single person in a vaccum. Thus, I consider artificial the use of "I" here. In other parts of this work, such first person plural will also include the reader, primarily when describing mathematical derivations, as a natural way of walking him through the process.}
